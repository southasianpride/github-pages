title: South Asian Pride
descrption: Ever felt isolated in a space that seems to value nothing more than having people around you?  <br> Growing up in a South Asian household; you are taught that it is just as important to look after and consider your family, your parents, your grandparents, your cousins, everyone around you as it is to look after and consider yourself. Sometimes even more so. So when you as a teenager, or maybe a young adult, realise there is something about you that cannot be changed, that immediately isolates you and seperates you from the community you grew up with.
